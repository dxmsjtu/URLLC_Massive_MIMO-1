function [V,W] = functionCombinerPrecoder(Hhat,C,R,nbrOfRealizations,M,K,L,p, combiner)
%Compute UL SE for different receive combining schemes using Theorem 4.1.
%
%INPUT:
%Hhat              = M x nbrOfRealizations x K x L x L matrix with the MMSE
%                    channel estimates
%C                 = M x M x K x L x L matrix with estimation error
%                    correlation matrices when using MMSE estimation
%R                 = M x M x K x L x L matrix with spatial correlation
%                    matrices
%tau_c             = Length of coherence block
%tau_p             = Length of pilot sequences
%nbrOfRealizations = Number of channel realizations
%M                 = Number of antennas per BS
%K                 = Number of UEs per cell
%L                 = Number of BSs and cells
%p                 = Uplink transmit power per UE (same for everyone)
%
%OUTPUT:
%SE_MR    = K x L matrix where element (k,l) is the uplink SE of UE k in
%           cell l achieved with MR combining
%SE_RZF   = Same as SE_MR but with RZF combining
%SE_MMMSE = Same as SE_MR but with M-MMSE combining
%SE_ZF    = Same as SE_MR but with ZF combining
%SE_SMMSE = Same as SE_MR but with S-MMSE combining
